-----------------------------------------------------------
Use div to mimic the button disadvantage:
- I can't actually focus on my button if i want to keyboard navigate
    you will need to add tab-index = 0, e.g. <div tabindex='0' class='menu-toggle'>...</div>

- Browser and assistive technologies don't really see this as an actual button
    Need to add role as button. e.g.  <div tabindex='0' role='button' class='menu-toggle'>...</div>

- Buttons need to be able to be interacted by clicking on them but also by being able to use your spacebar or by using the enter key
    Need to add javascript to handle those.


Better to put the button inside a <nav>, people who is using assistive technologies, they can actually skip straight to the nav.
This is a landmark region that is very easy to access with assistive technologies. so if they navigate straight to here and the first thing
in there is teh button and they can interact with that and actually open the navigation right away.
